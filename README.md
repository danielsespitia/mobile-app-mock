To run this project it is necessary to have Node.js and Expo installed on your machine, it is also necessary to have a Device Emulator (like Android Studio or simillar) installed to view the App in a mobile environment. You can also view the app directly on your phone or Expo Web Browser Emulation. 

To run the app, you have to install its dependencies first by running one of the following commands: `yarn install` or `npm install`. Once the dependencies installation is done, you will be able to run the app with the commands `yarn start` or `npm start` through your Expo Developer Tools and display it in your device emulator, smartphone or web browser.
